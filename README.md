# Synchronization Service

[![GitHub Actions CI](https://github.com/nmshd/bkb-synchronization/workflows/Publish/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nmshd/bkb-synchronization/actions?query=workflow%3APublish)

This service is used to synchronize the Datawallet of Identities between their different devices. It furthermore listens to events from other services (e.g. incoming Messages or new Relationship Changes) and saves them as so called `ExternalEvents` until the affected Identity fetches them.
